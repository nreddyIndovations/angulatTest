# The app uses AG-Grid for tabular display of the posts and filtering options
# It uses a scheduler which hits the posts url every 10 seconds
# The entire table will be refreshed on every 10 seconds which will close the model dialogues if any open. We can change this if we want.
# Filtering is implemented for Title column as requested
